Feature-Based Classification
----------------------------
For this task, I have done it on the local machine.
To get the SVC result, it took quite a very long time to finish in on the local machine. 

***
LSTM
----
For the LSTM task, I did it on google Colab notebooks due to GPU facilities and data saved to google drive.
I have used the Keras pre-trained model to build the LSTM.

***
BERT
----
For the BERT task worked on google Colab notebooks due to get a GPU, and all the data files and model saved on 
google drive.I used the google pre-train model for BERT.

At first, I used the local machine, which took a long time to test all the tasks. Later on, when I moved to google, 
Colab, things get very quick. Still, BERT took quite a significant time.
For this assignment lot of things were not apparent in terms of how to implement. However, reading the blog materials 
provided with the assignment helped quite a lot. Nevertheless, doing this assignment helps to familiarize me with the primary deep neural network.
